# Malicious-Traffic-Detection

Abstract â€”In this project, we have endeavored to enhance the capabilities of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) by employing a multi-faceted machine learning approach to analyze network traffic and detect anomalies. Utilizing the well-curated CICIDS2017 dataset, which features labeled real-world attack scenarios, our research undertook a systematic application of advanced machine learning techniques to address the complexities of network intrusion detection. 
	Our final analysis included a detailed evaluation of several algorithms, including K-Means Clustering, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks, each chosen for their potential to effectively identify subtle and overt cybersecurity threats. Throughout our exploration, we faced significant challenges that impacted the direction and outcomes of our research. Notably, we encountered suspiciously high accuracy rates in some of our models, suggesting potential data leakage, which prompted a thorough revision of our data handling and model validation processes. Additionally, the performance of unsupervised learning models was initially poor, highlighting the difficulties in tuning these models to effectively capture the nuanced behaviors characteristic of sophisticated network intrusions.
	Despite these setbacks, our iterative approach allowed us to refine our strategies and ultimately improve our models. Neural Networks, with their deep learning capabilities, provided the most robust detection rates, balancing precision and recall effectively. Moreover, our study ventured beyond mere algorithmic application; it also refined feature selection and data preprocessing to enhance model accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusively, our research not only advances the field of cybersecurity by providing actionable insights into IDS enhancement but also sets the groundwork for future explorations into adaptive learning models capable of countering evolving network threats. The implications of this work extend to real-world applications, where maintaining the integrity and security of network systems is paramount.
